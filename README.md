## Documentation for Python file

### Overview

learning-function-prologues.py is meant to try and determine whether an inputted string looks like a function prologue or not. It ingests the raw data from a binary that is generated through [symbull](https://github.com/hawkinsw/symbull). Given an input and the list of prologues, it will try and determine whether it is a prologue or not based on string similarity.

### Input

The python file only requires two inputs:
1. file_list: A folder containing .out files generated by symbull. This is important because the algorithm needs to read from these files to learn what a prologue is supposed to look like
2. input_code: A string input of the code that you want to evaluate as a prologue or not.

### Output

Output generated will show a probability that the input is a prologue or not.
